# gtExtras

The goal of [gtExtras](https://github.com/jthomasmock/gtExtras) is to
provide some additional helper functions to assist in creating beautiful
tables with [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com).

The functions are generally wrappers around boilerplate or adding
capabilities that are currently not *yet* built into
[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com). The [`{gt}`
package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) is amazing, make sure to go read the
official documentation.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("gtExtras")
```

## Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you
can install the development version of gtExtras from
